## Features in the Cloud Version

The cloud version includes a streamlined interface with:
- Real-time stock data visualization
- Interactive candlestick charts
- Basic stock information

## Supported Models

### LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Deep learning model ideal for time series prediction
- Uses 60-day sequences to predict future prices
- Best for capturing long-term patterns and trends

### Random Forest
- Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees
- Good for handling non-linear relationships
- Provides feature importance insights

### Linear Regression
- Simple baseline model for comparison
- Fast training and prediction
- Good for understanding linear relationships

## Technical Indicators

The software automatically calculates and uses the following technical indicators:

- **Moving Averages**: 5, 10, 20, 50-day periods
- **RSI**: Relative Strength Index for momentum analysis
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- **Bollinger Bands**: Price volatility indicators
- **Volume Indicators**: Volume ratios and trends
- **Price Ratios**: High/Low, Open/Close relationships

## Example Usage

```python
from data_processor import DataProcessor
from model_trainer import ModelTrainer
from predictor import StockPredictor

# Initialize components
processor = DataProcessor()
trainer = ModelTrainer()
predictor = StockPredictor()

# Fetch and process data
data = processor.fetch_stock_data("AAPL", period="2y")
processed_data = processor.prepare_features(data)

# Train model
model = trainer.train_model(processed_data, "lstm")

# Make predictions
predictions = predictor.predict(model, processed_data, days_ahead=7)
```

## Disclaimer

This software is for educational and research purposes only. Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions. Always consult with financial professionals and do your own research before making investment choices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Internet connection for fetching stock data
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended for LSTM training
